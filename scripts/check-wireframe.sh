#!/usr/bin/env sh
# check-wireframe.sh — a user-facing change must have a wireframe (and its interviews) before backend.
#
# THE SEAM THIS CLOSES. The wireframe rung exists as doctrine (`.agents/rules/wireframe-first.md`) and
# had no mechanical backstop, so the rung survived only as advice. Advice is exactly what drifts: it is
# unverifiable by reading a diff, it gets skipped under time pressure, and nobody can tell it was
# skipped. This gate makes the presence of the artifact checkable.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, and nothing more — PRESENCE ONLY:
#   1. A change with a user-facing surface has a sibling `wireframe/index.html`.
#   2. That wireframe has an `interviews.md` beside it.
#   3. Otherwise, the spec records `n/a — <reason>` (the reason is required; a bare `n/a` is refused).
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK. Not whether the wireframe is any good, not whether the layout
# suits the user, not whether the interviews were honest or the personas right, and not whether the
# screen matches the spec's stories. Those are review questions and are asked in the expert-review
# gate. A gate that claims to judge design would be measuring the wrong thing while looking rigorous —
# the failure this kit has already shipped once (a rule module asserting four checks, two of which did
# not exist). This gate answers exactly one question: does the artifact exist, and if not, was the skip
# written down with a reason. Nothing here is a quality claim.
