# A gate that cannot go red is not evidence. Both directions are asserted: a ship claim WITH a launch
# record (launch + rollback) passes, one WITHOUT is refused. Plus the adversarial cases a
# plausible-but-wrong implementation fails: a record naming only a launch (no rollback), a record naming
# only a rollback (no launch), a NON-ship change that must not be dragged in, the templates exemption,
# the escape hatch, and an empty `--since`. And — the load-bearing case — a MUTATION of the gate proves
# the canary is testing the gate's behaviour, not merely that a script exits 0.
#
# Every fixture is BUILT in a temp dir and stated directly, never sourced from a moving ref — the
# gate-integrity lesson about fixtures that test the ref instead of the behaviour.
