# Worklog

Running record of what actually happened — **one line per meaningful change, written in the SAME
commit as the change.** Continuous / chronological view (`in-progress.md` is current *state*; this is
*history*). Newest first.

> **This file exists only when the repo has no running changelog.** If the repo keeps a `CHANGELOG.md`
> or `HISTORY.md` with an `## [Unreleased]` section, THAT is the worklog — append there and delete this
> file. Never keep two parallel running logs. `/adapt-claude-setup` picks the target and reports which
> one it chose.

A change earns a line when it lands source, config, schema, or shipped docs. Trivial typo / format-only
commits need none. The line is part of the diff, not a follow-up — **shipped-but-unlogged counts as not
done** (`.claude/rules/documentation.md`).

## Format

`- YYYY-MM-DD · <what changed, imperative> · \`<where: file or area>\` · <initiative / queue-row, if any>`

Append-only, never pruned. On ship: promote the durable entry to `completed-features.md` and move the
`roadmap.md` initiative, in the same commit.
