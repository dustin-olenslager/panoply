# factory-detect.sh — which phase is this repo in? Reports phase, evidence, and next step.
#
# M2 of the factory build. This DETECTS and REPORTS; it changes nothing and decides nothing else.
# Reading the phase and acting on the phase are separate on purpose: the detector must be provable
# against fixtures before anything is allowed to act on its answer.
#
# THE RULE, in one sentence: scan the repo's evidence from the END backward, and report the FURTHEST
# phase whose completion is actually evidenced — today's build is the newest thing that happened, so
# evidence of a later phase outranks evidence of an earlier one.
#
# Every observation is a file test or a grep. No network, no model call, no guessing. If the answer
# disagrees with what you know, the report names the exact observation that was wrong — which is the
# whole point of reporting evidence rather than a verdict.
#
#   sh scripts/factory-detect.sh              # report on the current repo
#   sh scripts/factory-detect.sh --path DIR   # report on another checkout
#   sh scripts/factory-detect.sh --json       # machine-readable, for a later rung to consume
#
# Exit codes: 0 = a phase was detected (INCLUDING phase 0), 2 = could not inspect (not a repo,
# unreadable). A phase is never reported as an error: "this repo is at ADOPT" is a successful
# answer, not a failure.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE — read before trusting a result:
#   It reports the phase the FILES evidence, not the phase the WORK is in. A plan whose milestones
#   are all ticked but which shipped nothing reads as done. A branch with commits but no CI signal
#   discoverable locally reads as BUILD when it is really at VERIFY. It cannot see intent, quality,
#   or whether the artifacts are any good — only that they exist and what they say about themselves.
#   And it cannot see a repo whose kit is stale as anything but PHASE 0: below that line, the phase
#   history is not trustworthy, which is the honest reading rather than a defect.
