# check-launch.sh — the Ship rung: a change claiming it SHIPPED must record a launch and a way back.
#
# THE SEAM THIS CLOSES. `scripts/factory-phases.tsv` names phase 6 (Ship) with a `-` in its gate
# column, and the doctrine calls that "a stated gap, not a licence": nothing stood between "verify
# passed" and "in production". Phases 0-3 are gated; 4 and 5 have no gate by design (they are states of
# work, not artifacts). Ship is different — it is a CLAIM ("this is live"), and a claim nothing checks
# is exactly the kind of unchecked assertion this kit exists to refuse.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, and nothing more — PRESENCE ONLY:
#   1. A change that marks a SHIP milestone complete must record, in the same feature folder, that the
#      thing was launched and how to get back out (a rollback line) — a sibling `launch.md`, or a
#      `## Launch` section in the plan. The record is required to NAME both a launch and a rollback;
#      a record that names only one is refused.
#   2. Otherwise the change is not at the ship rung, and this gate has nothing to say.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK. Not whether the deploy actually happened, not whether the
# rollback command works, not which mechanism deploys (Vercel, docker-compose, a bare box — the gate
# never guesses the deploy path). Those are review questions, and the mechanism is stack-specific,
# which a POSIX-sh kit deliberately is not. This gate answers exactly one question: did the change that
# says it shipped write down a launch and a rollback line. Nothing here is a quality claim.
