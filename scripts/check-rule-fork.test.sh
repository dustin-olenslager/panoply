# Why this exists: a drift gate that only ever reports "OK" looks identical to a gate that works, and
# one that always reports drift is the always-red gate nobody reads. This asserts BOTH directions —
# a target that silently DROPPED a policy rung is REFUSED, a target that legitimately ADAPTED (paths
# retargeted, placeholders filled, default branch named) PASSES, and a target that deliberately
# diverges with an allowlist entry is not blocked — so "detects real drift" is distinguishable from
# "blocks nothing" and from "blocks every legitimate adaptation".
#
# The fixtures build a miniature KIT (scripts/ + .agents/rules/) so the gate's "kit rules dir is
# $0/../.agents/rules" resolution is exercised exactly as in production, and a miniature TARGET with
# its own .claude/rules/. Nothing real is touched.
