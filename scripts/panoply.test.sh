#
# Why this exists: the kit's own rules require that any gate which pattern-matches must ship a
# fixture that carries every defect it claims to catch, plus a compliant one, and assert
# fail-then-pass. A single manual pass on a real repo cannot distinguish "compliant" from
# "detects nothing" — a check that always exits 0 looks identical to a perfect one.
#
# Asserts every state the doctor can report, by building a throwaway repo per case:
#   current(0) absent(10) partial(11) stale(12) placeholders(13) drifted(14) off(0) not-a-repo(0)
#
#   sh scripts/panoply.test.sh        (run from the kit root; used by CI)
set -u
# pipefail is a bash extension. CI invokes this gate as `sh scripts/panoply.test.sh`, where `sh` is
# dash and `set -o pipefail` is an illegal option that aborts the run before any check executes —
# a gate that cannot start reads as a broken repo rather than a broken check. Enable it only where
# the shell supports it (an `if`, not `A && B || C`, which older shellcheck flags as SC2015).

# answered it. From the kit SOURCE it asked "what release is this?" (`git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
# on a checkout with untagged commits since the last tag yields `v1.4.0-14-gc0dee04`, and the
# `[ -n "$v" ]` guard then reads that as a version — not `unreleased`). From a CANONICAL CLONE it
# asked "what is the nearest ancestor tag?", which is a different question with a different answer.
# So `apply` stamped one value and the copied doctor reported another, and the mismatch only appeared
# for whoever happened to have a canonical clone on the machine — a local-only false red in the one
# gate adopters are told to run.
#
# The bug hides on a machine with no canonical clone (`_canonical_kit_root` fails, the stamp is
# believed, both agree) and on a tagged kit checkout. It shows up exactly when the kit has untagged
# commits AND a clone exists. Force BOTH conditions here, or this case passes for the wrong reason.
